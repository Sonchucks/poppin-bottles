# Poppin Bottles
======

## Task 1

- Create an algorithm that will calculate the following:
  - Each bottle of pop costs $2 to purchase.
  - For every two empty bottles, you can get one free (full) bottle of pop.
  - For every four bottle caps, you can get one free (full) bottle of pop.
- For Example
  - Given a $20 investment, the customer will get 10 bottles of pop. That gives a supply of both bottles and bottle caps that can be used to redeem for further bottles, which will then produce a further supply for recycling.

## Task 2
- Modify your program to accept an argument (```.argv```) that will allow the user to specify the amount (in dollars) that the customer is going to spend.
- The node script will then calculate the total number of bottles that the customer will receive.

## Task 3
- Modify your code to output a breakdown of how many bottles were:
  - Purchased
  - Obtained through bottle recycling
  - Obtained through bottle cap recycling

## Task 4
- Add to the output above so that the program will tell the customer how many bottles and bottle caps they will have left over.

## TIP! Iterate, Iterate, Iterate
- Build the code incrementally.
- Build it in small steps and make sure that the code is functioning properly before moving on.
